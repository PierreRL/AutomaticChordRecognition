\section{Aims}

The aims of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop a model that can generate lead sheets from audio recordings of music.
    \item To implement and evaluate current state-of-the-art models for music transcription and generation.
    \item Investigate the use of different data representations for music transcription and generation.
    \item To evaluate the performance of the model on a variety of music genres and styles.
    \item To investigate the use of different models/datasets/data augmentation methods for automatic chord recognition, melody transcription and lyric transcription.
\end{itemize}
