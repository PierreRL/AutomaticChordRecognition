\chapter{Model Comparison}

In this section, we compare various model in the \emph{Pop} dataset. We start by describing

\section{Baseline}

- Simple logistic regression, single-layer NN.

\section{CRNN}
- Describe simple model from CQT through CNNs and RNNs
- Transition frame analysis
- Incorrect region analysis
- Hop length
- Re-weighting loss

\section{Structured Training}

\section{Transformer}
- Transformer expansion

\section{Using Generative Features}
- Using generative features
