\section{Conclusions}

- What do the results say?

\section{Limitations}
Limitations:
- Genre
- Standard tuning, Western
- No lyrics
- No beat/segmentation detection
- No chord inversion
- Size of vocabulary lacking leading to tricky X chord

\section{Further Work}
Further work:
- More data e.g. HookTheory
- Larger vocabulary? Inversion as in? Why didn't I do this?
- Make into a useful tool by outputting chords in a more useful format
- Investigate other methods of synthetic data generation?
- Stuff I didn't have time to incorporate e.g. beat/segmentation detection, transformers, structured loss, curriculum learning
