    This skeleton demonstrates how to use the \texttt{infthesis} style for
    undergraduate dissertations in the School of Informatics. It also emphasises the
    page limit, and that you must not deviate from the required style.
    The file \texttt{skeleton.tex} generates this document and should be used as a
    starting point for your thesis. Replace this abstract text with a concise
    summary of your report.
